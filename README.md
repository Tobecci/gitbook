### Hard route is better trust me

- cd ~
- mkdir bash_scripts
- cd bash_scripts
- pwd
- copy the gitbook file into the bash_scripts folder and copy the path shown in the terminal by the pwd commmand
- and type the following command
- sudo gedit /etc/environment
- then in the opened file append :path_you_copied to the path variable
- then restart your system by typing reboot
- open a terminal and type gitbook
- if the script doesn't work do
- sudo chmod 755 ~/bash_scripts/gitbook
- from now on any bash scripts in the bash_scripts folder will run when you type their name in the terminal
